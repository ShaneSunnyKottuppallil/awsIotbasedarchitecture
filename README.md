Updated Architecture:
 
1. Multitenancy Implementation:
•	User Segmentation: Use AWS Cognito for tenant-specific authentication and authorization. Assign custom attributes to users to identify their tenant.
•	Data Isolation:
o	Use DynamoDB with tenant-specific partition keys to ensure logical data isolation.
•	Shared Resources:
o	Use resource tagging to distinguish tenant-related resources (e.g., S3 buckets, IoT Core topics).
o	Leverage AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share common services like SageMaker models.
•	Custom APIs:
o	Design APIs with tenant IDs to process tenant-specific requests through API Gateway and Lambda.
2. High Availability Across Multi-Geo Locations:
•	Region Distribution: Deploy resources like Lambda, DynamoDB, and IoT Core across multiple AWS regions.

•	Global Data Synchronization:
o	Use DynamoDB Global Tables for replicating user and device data across regions.
o	Employ S3 cross-region replication for storing IoT data.
•	Monitoring: Deploy CloudWatch metrics and alarms in each region to monitor application health and failover triggers.

3.	 Steps for Cost Optimization:
•	Removed Glue and Quicksight.
	Using AWS Lambda with IoT Analytics instead of Glue and Quicksight.
Cost Breakdown:
1)	AWS Lambda:
o	Charged based on the number of invocations and execution time.
o	Cost-effective for small to medium-scale workloads as Lambda scales automatically and you only pay for what you use.
2)	IoT Analytics:
o	S3: Storage costs for processed data; cheaper than Glue's managed catalog.
o	Data Set Queries: Charged per query and the amount of data queried.
o	Visualization: Built-in visualization tools in IoT Analytics.
